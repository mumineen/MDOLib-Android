# MDOLib-Android

Includes shared object files for 4 architectures: arm64, arm, x86, x86_64

The java source (declaring the methods that have been implemented in the shared object files) is included in MdoSalaat.java.

A prebuilt AAR file has also been provided.  This can be added to an existing project, and then the library can be imported as org.mumineen.MdoSalaat.
